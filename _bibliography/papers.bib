  abstract={In this article, we present PixelClipper, a tool built for facilitating data engagement events. PixelClipper supports conversations around visualizations in public settings through annotation and commenting capabilities. It is recognized that understanding data is important for an informed society. However, even when visualizations are available on the web, open data is not yet reaching all audiences. Public facilitated events centered around data visualizations may help bridge this gap. PixelClipper is designed to promote discussion and engagement with visualizations in public settings. It allows viewers to quickly and expressively extract visual clippings from visualizations and add comments to them. Ambient and facilitator displays attract attention by showing clippings. They function as entry points to the full visualizations while supporting deeper conversations about the visualizations and data. We describe the design goals of PixelClipper, share our experiences from deploying it, and discuss its future potential in supporting data visualization engagement events.},

  abstract={We reflect on our experiences as designers of COVID-19 data visualizations working in a distributed synchronous design space during the pandemic. This is especially relevant as the pandemic posed new challenges to distributed collaboration amidst civic lockdown measures and an increased dependency on spatially distributed teamwork across almost all sectors. Working from home being'the new normal', we explored potential solutions for collaborating and prototyping remotely from our own homes using the existing tools at our disposal. Since members of our cross-disciplinary team had different technical skills, we used a range of synchronous remote design tools and methods. We aimed to preserve the richness of co-located collaboration such as face-to-face physical presence, body gestures, facial expressions, and the making and sharing of physical artifacts. While meeting over Zoom, we sketched on paper and used digital collaboration tools, such as Miro and Google Docs. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we articulate our challenges and strategies throughout the process, providing useful insights about synchronous distributed collaboration.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic unveiled a strong need for advanced and informative surveillance tools. The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) at the University of Calgary took action to develop a surveillance dashboard, which would facilitate the education of the public, and answer critical questions posed by local and national government. OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was to create an interactive method of surveillance, or a “COVID-19 Tracker” for Canadian use. The Tracker offers user-friendly graphics characterizing various aspects of the current pandemic (e.g. case count, testing, hospitalizations, and policy interventions). METHODS. Six publicly available data sources were used, and were selected based on the frequency of updates, accuracy and types of data, and data presentation. The datasets have different levels of granularity for different provinces, which limits the information that we are able to show. Additionally, some datasets have missing entries, for which the “last observation carried forward” method was used. The website was created and hosted online, with a backend server, which is updated on a daily basis. The Tracker development followed an iterative process, as new figures were added to meet the changing needs of policy-makers. RESULTS. The resulting Tracker is a dashboard that visualizes real-time data, along with policy interventions from various countries, via user-friendly graphs with a hover option that reveals detailed information. The interactive features allow the user to customize the figures by jurisdiction, country/region, and the type of data shown. Data is displayed at the national and provincial level, as well as by health regions. CONCLUSION. The COVID-19 Tracker offers real-time, detailed, and interactive visualizations that have the potential to shape crucial decision-making and inform Albertans and Canadians of the current pandemic.}

  author={Walny, Jagoda and Frisson, Christian and West, Mieka and Kosminsky, Doris and Knudsen, S{\o}ren and Carpendale, Sheelagh and Willett, Wesley},
  abstract={Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.},

We designed PADE based on inquiries with healthcare data analysts tasked with understanding expenses in a healthcare system that serve about six million residents. Our goals in designing the system were to enable the analysts to collaboratively construct hypotheses, quickly generate and execute strategies, and support ad hoc discussions and Q&A sessions during meetings. We created a set of interaction techniques that let users create new visualizations and combine parts of existing ones, and illustrate these possibilities through an analysis scenario. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of PADE, its interaction techniques, and future work in this direction.},

  abstract={We present our preliminary results of an international survey on the practical adoption and use of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from a visualization and visual analytics perspective. The ICD system, in different versions, is globally used for coding morbidity and mortality statistics, however, coding practices vary across countries. Our survey includes questions about hospital data collection systems, use of features in ICD, and training of ICD coding specialists. Variations in ICD could hinder comparability and limit generalizability of observed findings. Our preliminary results establish the current state of ICD use and training internationally, and will ultimately be valuable to the World Health Organization to further research on how to improve ICD coding, and enhance international comparisons of health data. From a visualization and visual analytics perspective, the current differences in adoption and use of ICD poses challenges and opportunities. For example, when morbidity-data from two countries differ in their coding, can we still compare data from these countries, and if so, then under which circumstances? We discuss how visualization and visual analytics might help in these situations.},

  abstract={Constructive approaches to visualization authoring have been shown to offer advantages such as providing options for flexible outputs, scaffolding and ideation of new data mappings, personalized exploration of data, as well as supporting data understanding and literacy. However, visualization authoring tools based on a constructive approach do not scale well to larger datasets. As construction often involves manipulating small pieces of data and visuals, it requires a significant amount of time, effort, and repetitive steps. We present ReConstructor, an authoring tool in which a visualization is constructed by instantiating its structural and functional components through four interaction elements (objects, modifiers, activators, and tools). This design preserves most of the benefits of a constructive process while avoiding scalability issues by allowing designers to propagate individual mapping steps to all the elements of a visualization. We also discuss the perceived benefits of our approach and propose avenues for future research in this area.},

  abstract={Data visualizations are often represented in public discourse as objective proof of facts. However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.},

  abstract={Visualization systems with multiple views are often used to represent data from different perspectives. There are many advantages in doing so, such as providing a way for users to understand a dataset by revealing its various attributes in separate views and offering additional information that could be more useful than if it was just one graph. However, this can often make data seem complicated and overwhelming as each view remains independent. We present a visualization that utilizes multiple views as a means for interaction and unifying the different data dimensions of a multi-view system. This creates a cohesive visualization that displays different aspects of the data, in this case, hierarchical text data and numerical data. With this personal data visualization, we offer a potential solution for relating additional data structures through interaction while maintaining different data types shown and linking multiple views to form a larger connected graph.},

We argue that it is sensible to understand data requirements and evaluate the potential value of visualization before devising means of automatic data collection. We base our exploration on three cases selected to span a range of factors, such as the role of the person doing the data collection and the type of instrumentation used. The three cases relate to visualizing sports, construction, and cooking domain data, and use primarily time-domain data and visualizations. For each case, we briefly describe the design case and problem, the manner in which we collected data, and the findings obtained from evaluations.

We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples’ use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples’ level of visualization literacy.},

	abstract = "This thesis explores information visualizations on large, high-resolution touch displays for analysis of massive amounts of data. The ever increasing rate at which data is collected about everything from peoples{\textquoteright} health, over organisations expenditures, to scientific experiments, necessitates new data analysis techniques. Information visualizations on large, high-resolution touch displays is a promising answer to these needs, and provide abundant display space for people to make sense of data. However, little is known about how to tailor interactive visualizations to abundant display space or about the benefits they might bring. The present thesis draws on the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) and information visualization (InfoVis) to answer these questions.",

  abstract={People typically interact with information visualizations using a mouse. Their physical movement, orientation, and distance to visualizations are rarely used as input. We explore how to use such spatial relations among people and visualizations (i.e., proxemics) to drive interaction with visualizations, focusing here on the spatial relations between a single user and visualizations on a large display. We implement interaction techniques that zoom and pan, query and relate, and adapt visualizations based on tracking of users' position in relation to a large high-resolution display. Alternative prototypes are tested in three user studies and compared with baseline conditions that use a mouse. Our aim is to gain empirical data on the usefulness of a range of design possibilities and to generate more ideas. Among other things, the results show promise for changing zoom level or visual representation with the user's physical distance to a large display. We discuss possible benefits and potential issues to avoid when designing information visualizations that use proxemics.},

  abstract={Large, high-resolution displays offer new opportunities for visualizing and interacting with data. However, interaction techniques for such displays mostly support window manipulation and pointing, ignoring many activities involved in data analysis. We report on 11 workshops with data analysts from various fields, including artistic photography, phone log analysis, astrophysics, and health care policy. Analysts were asked to walk through recent tasks using actual data on a large whiteboard, imagining it to be a large display. From the resulting comments and a video analysis of behavior in the workshops, we generate ideas for new interaction techniques for large displays. These ideas include supporting sequences of visualizations with backtracking and fluid exploration of alternatives; using distance to the display to change visualizations; and fixing variables and data sets on the display or relative to the user.},

  author={Knudsen, S{\o}ren},

  abstract={The traditional graphical user interface employing windows, icons, menus and pointers show weaknesses in face to face collaboration, and has done so during its lifetime. The hype of multi-touch technology marks a new and promising path for treading new lands in computer use. Tangible computing is another less hyped futuristic interaction method on the verge to mass media coverage. Discovering the differences and similarities of these two methods of interaction in face to face collaboration applications is not one possible, but needed, in order to understand, not just what to design, but how to design it.
In the works, collaboration performance of the two interaction methods is held up in the light, fir everybody to perceive and evaluate the differences. It is shown, that the two interaction methods are rather collaborators than contestants – they augment each other well, showing strengths, where the other show weaknesses.
It is described how a tabletop system, which supports both methods of interaction is designed, built and used for subsequent evaluations. The possibilities of a system, utilizing these interaction methods, in design of signal processing systems in a research group, is proposed, analyzed, and evaluated — although never fully implemented
The major conclusion stemming from this work is, that that combination of multi-touch interaction and tangible computing should be experienced, in order to fully understand their possibilities. The single-most important problem facing this conclusion is, that these interaction systems don’t exist commercially yet.},

In the present version we focus on multimedia search related to music and we present two prototype search applications (web-based and mobile). A category based filtering approach enables the user to refine a search through relevance feedback by category selection instead of typing additional text, which was found to be an advantage in the mobile MuZeeker application. We report from a usability evaluation using the think aloud protocol, in which N=10 participants performed tasks using respectively MuZeeker and a customized Google search engine. The experiment gave initial indications that participants were capable of solving tasks slightly better using MuZeeker, while the "inexperienced" MuZeeker users performed slightly slower than experienced Google users. 75% of the participants reported a subjective preference for MuZeeker.},
