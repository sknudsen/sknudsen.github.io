I have recently been informed that I had been fortunate to receieve a Marie Curie postdoctoral grant for my VIVIR (short for VIsualizing VIew Relations) project application to work with Professor Sheelagh Carpendale (University of Calgary) and Kasper Hornbæk (University of Copenhagen) for three full years!

The first two years, I will be spending in the iLab at the Computer Science department of University of Calgary, Canada. The third year, I will return to Europe and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

The topic of my work is to increase our understanding of the notion of multiple views in visualization, bridging a theoretical foundation with concrete application examples in health data analysis and ubiqoutous collaborative analytics.
