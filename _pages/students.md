Please contact me if you're interested in working with me. I enjoy working with students across all levels and am often looking for people to join our team (BSC to Postdoc).

## Current Bachelor or Masters students
For inspiration for course projects (7.5 ECTS), Bachelor thesis projects (15 ETCS), and Master thesis projects (30 ECTS), please see [project inspiration](https://github.itu.dk/pages/soekn/sorenknudsen.com-restricted/project-inspiration) (use your ITU credentials to gain access).

## Potential PhD students
We are currently looking for PhD students to respond to our open call for ITU scholarships. I have proposed three projects with colleagues from the digital design department and the computer science department.

The current pandemic and global warming crises have emphasized the need for contemporary democratic

<!-- ### Data-Driven Debate for Digital Societies
*(PhD open call 2022)*

The current pandemic and global warming crises have emphasized the need for contemporary democratic
societies to be able to engage in data-informed public debates. Contemporary societies collect increasing
amounts of data to allow policy makers to make informed decisions. However, current technologies lack ways
for different stakeholders to take part in these decisions on similar terms.

This PhD aims to contribute visualization technologies that enable people to partake in data-based discussions,
with the aim to improve democratic processes rather than pave the way for technocracy. Doing so, we build on
prior work on collaborative and social visualization to identify shortcomings when considered in the context of
argumentation and disagreement.

During the project, we will study technologies in societal use, and we will create novel technologies that support
in-person and online data debate. To create a rich understanding of the phenomena that might be involved in
data debates, we will first conduct studies in our lab that construct close-to natural situations where
participants engage in in-person data discussions based on data visualizations. We will also study how people
use existing tools to participate in online data discussions in parallel to our lab-based efforts and compare the
insight from our two approaches. We plan to use our study insights to identify promising directions for designing
new visualization techniques and technologies for online, interactive, data-based discussions and will explore
possibilities for evaluating these in lab studies and studies that offer higher degrees of external validity.

<!-- ### Data Visualization and Natural Languages
*(PhD open call 2022)*

Data visualization has been suggested to be a form of language. To that end, several connections between
knowledge of data visualization and natural languages have been noted by the visualization research
community, to the point that it is now commonplace to discuss how people might “read” a visualization. Notable
examples of such connections include knowledge of literacy, which has strongly inspired the notion of data
visualization literacy; language acquisition in early childhood, which plays an important role in the concept of
constructive visualization; active reading, which was studied in the context of working with data visualizations;
rhetoric, which has inspired work on visualization rhetoric; and critical text analysis, which has given way to
critical “readings” of data visualizations that build on the rich traditions of humanistic scholarship.

However, these many ways to use the rich knowledge that we have about our natural languages to inform
visualization research and design currently exists as isolated islands of knowledge. To date, the work to collect
these different approaches, to connect them, and to uncover what we might have missed in terms of knowledge
translation between these two knowledge domains remains.

This PhD aims to contribute insights from considering the domains of data visualization and natural languages
together. It asks, what are the parallels between the domains, what are the unexplored areas, what are the
strong examples of inspiration, and how might we build from those?

The project will survey existing research that intersect the two domains to establish a framework that help to
understand and think about the two domains. The framework, readings within the domains, and consultations
with language experts will help uncover unexplored areas and incongruencies between the domains and
provide opportunities for grand breakthroughs. For example, in visualization, “authoring” means to manually
create a well-known visualization design, while in the context of natural languages, “authoring” has a different
meaning. Might there be other ways to consider visualization authoring that can be fruitfully applied in
visualization research? Based on the opportunities identified in the framework, the project will explore
promising directions in combining the two knowledge domains.

We envision this work to lead to new insights about visualization authoring, visualization production, and
visualization reading. While we imagine most of this work to contribute to the emerging body of work in data
visualization, it will consider contributions to the rich existing body of work on languages that are inspired from
data visualization knowledge.

The candidate for this project should have a strong background in:
* The field of digital design or computer science. The candidate should have a good understanding of
data visualization, and might possess the skills needed for development of research prototypes, or
* The field of social sciences and humanities (such as, but not limited to, language, linguistics, or
cognition). The candidate should be interested in pursuing more technical research and a particular
interest in data and data visualization.

Ideally, the candidate presents a relevant and interesting profile that intersects the two mentioned fields, or a
strong background in one of the two and a genuine interest in and understanding of the other.

<!-- ### Automatic Assessment and Visualization of Programming Skill for Learners and Educators
*(PhD open call 2022)*

IT literacy is an essential skill in our times and, given the dynamism of the IT domain, programming-related
learning is likely to become a life-long activity for many. Since there are disproportionately more students of
programming than teachers, a great challenge in education will be the ability to assess and meet each student
at their skill level and to provide suitable exercises, content, and feedback.

This Ph.D. project aims to develop novel technologies that will help people understand their own, their peers,
and their students' programming skills and weaknesses. The project will develop tools for the continuous
assessment of skill level. This will be achieved by monitoring and analyzing the source code committed by
learners to version control systems, a technique from the field of mining software repositories. Visualization
tools strived at helping users understand and monitor skills will be designed based on the scholarship of
teaching and learning as well as the techniques that have emerged from information visualization (InfoVis) and
the related field of software visualization.

The resulting tools and techniques will foster scaffolded self-evaluation and problem-solving skills for all
students of programming, with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of IT education for students and
educators worldwide.
